Personal website and blog of **Thiti Phutaarmart** — a full-stack developer and NLP researcher from Thailand, currently based in Ishikawa, Japan.

My research focuses on applying **Large Language Models** to **low-resource language** tasks and **NLP** challenges.

As a freelance developer, I've built production systems ranging from digital wallets processing 220,000+ USD/month to RAG-powered chatbots for industrial documentation. I enjoy bridging the gap between research and real-world applications.
