title: "DREAM-LLMs: A Deliberation-Based Reasoning Ensemble Approach With Multiple Large Language Models for Term Typing in Low-Resource"
description: "We propose DREAM-LLMs: a Deliberation-based Reasoning Ensemble Approach with Multiple Large Language Models. Our method queries four advanced LLMs independently and introduces a deliberation step where one LLM reviews the others' predictions to produce a final decision. Evaluated on three low-resource domain datasets achieving F1 scores of 0.908 (OBI), 0.568 (MatOnto), and 0.593 (SWEET)."
